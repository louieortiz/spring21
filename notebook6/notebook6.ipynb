    "Fields can be useful for mapping continuous values that are generated using statistical or \n",
    "physical models. These can be very complex, so we are going to do a simple heatmap that is essentially a spatial histogram.\n",
    "In the traditional histogram a count of how many features fell within a value range is plotted in a bar plot. In a heatmap\n",
    "a count of how many points fell within a pixel is counted and that count is displayed in the pixel color. Some \n",
    "examples of more complex spatial statistics include interpolation and measuring clusterrandomness; two major processes in spatial data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about other examples of using a raster dataset as a field with statistical values [check out this lab guide by Penn](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ese502/NOTEBOOK/Part_II/2_Examples_of_Continuous_Spatial_Data.pdf).\n",
    "There are now some python and R libraries that can compute a variety of spatial statistical models, for example pylandstats is one used to quantify landscape shape, and [pysal](https://pysal.org/) is a very powerful library tackling spatial statistics similar to GeoDa but for python users.\n"

In the Maantay reading assigned this week we learn about the difficulty in mapping exposure to hazards. The map generated by the heatmap function looks authoritative, but is it actually telling you anything other than where there are existing wells with TCE levels above regulations? \n",

    "When deciding how to collectively manage these sites, we are faced with the complications of history. The historical and ongoing delineations of political jurisdiction, the complexity of bio-chemical and geologic processes all contribute to our limitated understanding the whole system. However, the biggest impediment in using environmental data to guide justice projects centered on community decision making, is that our justice system is not built to protect environments we do not understand or to manage the environment collectively.  \n",
